# todo-app

My todo app is modeled off the todo app project from [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy. As a learning experience I removed any JQuery dependencies and made a few cosmetic alterations. I will periodically add new features. A live version of the app can be found [here](https://kevinrompala.com/projects/todo-app/todo.html).

## Version History

v1.0 - Initial release. Feature parity with course project with minor alterations.
